# Steps to generate tests:

Follow the given steps to generate tests:


1. Set `VLEN` in the `constants.py` file

2. Since we are already in the `.../isa/...` directory, we don't need to set it in `constants.py` file

3. Run `python3 generate.py` in terminal

4. The macros and header file changes are very specific to the tests generated by this generator, other sourced tests should properly bring their own header and macros files

5. Remove/Add tests in the `Makefrag` to compile and run them on ARA as per needed

   

The header file and macro file changes are already in this branch `verif_yl_rc3start_sept7`.
