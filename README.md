# Ara

Ara is a vector unit working as a coprocessor for the CVA6 core.
It supports the RISC-V Vector Extension, [version 0.9](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.9).

## Supported instructions

Check `FUNCTIONALITIES.md` to check which instructions are currently support by Ara.

## Get started

Make sure you clone this repository recursively to get all the necessary submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If the repository path of any submodule changes, run the following command to change your submodule's pointer to the remote repository:

```bash
git submodule sync --recursive
```

## Toolchain

Ara requires a RISC-V GCC toolchain capable of understanding the vector extension, version 0.9.x.

To build this toolchain, run the following command in the project's root directory.

```bash
# Build the GCC toolchain
make toolchain
```

## Verilator

Ara requires an updated version of Verilator, for RTL simulations.

To build it, run the following command in the project's root directory.

```bash
# Build Verilator
make verilator
```

## Configuration

Ara's parameters are centralized in the `config` folder, in the `config.mk` file.
Please check `config/README.md` for more details.

## Software

### Build Applications

The `apps` folder contains example applications that work on Ara. Run the following command to build an application. E.g., `hello_world`:

```bash
cd apps
make bin/hello_world
```

### RISC-V Tests

The `apps` folder also contains the RISC-V tests repository, including a few unit tests for the vector instructions. Run the following command to build the unit tests:

```bash
cd apps
make riscv_tests
```

## RTL Simulation

To simulate the Ara system with ModelSim, go to the `hardware` folder, which contains all the SystemVerilog files. Use the following command to run your simulation:

```bash
# Go to the hardware folder
cd hardware
# Apply the patches (only need to run this once)
make apply-patches
# Only compile the hardware without running the simulation.
make build
# Run the simulation with the *hello_world* binary loaded
app=hello_world make sim
# Run the simulation with the *some_binary* binary. This allows specifying the full path to the binary
preload=/some_path/some_binary make sim
# Run the simulation without starting the gui
app=hello_world make simc
```

It is also possible to simulate the unit tests compiled in the `apps` folder. Given the number of unit tests, we use Verilator. Use the following command to install Verilator, verilate the design, and run the simulation:

```bash
# Go to the hardware folder
cd hardware
# Apply the patches (only need to run this once)
make apply-patches
# Verilate the design
make verilate
# Run the tests
make riscv_tests_simv
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `riscv_tests` target at Ara's top-level Makefile to both compile the RISC-V tests and run their simulation.
